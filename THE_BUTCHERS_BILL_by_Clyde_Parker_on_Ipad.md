Overview
New York City is the backdrop for a toxic expose&#039; where ethics and morality are blurred in an ever changing and nuanced environment. Human trafficking from south of the border to the northeast resulting in domestic and sexual servitude is the catalyst that sets in motion efforts to aid or hinder the disruption of business as usual.
 Mixed inextricable in this cauldron of calamity are a brother and sister trying to finally salvage salvation, yet their lives and those whose lives they touch are also tinted in shades of gray. Also entangled is a Zionist organization in the heart of the city connecting the like-minded in support of Israel, along with a psychiatrist who cares little of current social norms while also flying too close to the sun in his march toward redemption.
 For those who survive do so through struggle, suffering, and a steadfast resolve to persevere.
