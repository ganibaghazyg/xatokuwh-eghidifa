A diabolical collection of stories featuring achingly human characters whose lives intertwine with ghosts, goblins, and the macabre, by¬†‚ÄúBuenos Aires‚Äôs sorceress of horror‚Äù (Samanta Schweblin, The New York Times)
 
 ‚ÄúEntertaining, political and exquisitely gruesome, these stories summon terror against the backdrop of everyday horrors. . . . A queen of horror delivers more delightfully twisted stories.‚Äù‚ÄîLos Angeles Times
 
 ‚ÄúAs vivid and essential as Kafka‚Äôs tales.‚Äù‚ÄîMinneapolis Star-Tribune

 On the shores of this river, all the birds that fly, drink, perch on branches, and disturb siestas with the demonic squawking of the possessed‚Äîall those birds were once women.
 
 Welcome to Argentina and the fascinating, frightening, fantastical imagination of Mariana Enriquez. In twelve spellbinding new stories, Enriquez writes about ordinary people, especially women, whose lives turn inside out when they encounter terror, the surreal, and the supernatural. A neighborhood nuisanced by ghosts, a family whose faces melt away, a faded hotel haunted by a girl who dissolved in the water tank on the roof, a riverbank populated by birds that used to be women‚Äîthese and other tales illuminate the shadows of contemporary life, where the line between good and evil no longer exists.
 
 Lyrical and hypnotic, heart-stopping and deeply moving, Enriquez‚Äôs stories never fail to enthrall, entertain, and leave us shaken. Translated by the award-winning Megan McDowell, A Sunny Place for Shady People showcases Enriquez‚Äôs unique blend of the literary and the horrific, and underscores why Kazuo Ishiguro, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, calls her ‚Äúthe most exciting discovery I‚Äôve made in fiction for some time.‚Äù
