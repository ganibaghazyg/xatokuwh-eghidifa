Overview
A government special agent known only as the Signalman gets off a train on a stunningly hot morning in Winslow, Arizona. Later that day he meets a woman in a diner to exchange information about an event that happened a week earlier for which neither has an explanation, but which haunts the Signalman.
 
 In a ranch house near the shore of the Salton Sea a cult leader gathers up the weak and susceptible â€” the Children of the Next Level â€” and offers them something to believe in and a chance for transcendence. The future is coming and they will help to usher it in.
 
 A day after the events at the ranch house which disturbed the Signalman so deeply that he and his government sought out help from â€˜otherâ€™ sources, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory abruptly loses contact with NASA&#039;s interplanetary probe New Horizons. Something out beyond the orbit of Pluto has made contact.
 
 And a woman floating outside of time looks to the future and the past for answers to what can save humanity.
 
 Agents of Dreamland is a new Lovecraftian horror novella from award-winning author CaitlÃ­n R. Kiernan.
