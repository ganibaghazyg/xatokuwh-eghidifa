WHAT MAKES US HAPPY? BILL BAILEY PLAYS CRAZY GOLF AND HUGS TREES TO FIND OUT.

&amp;#039;A warm, funny read, full of personal anecdotes and love letters to things that bring Bill Bailey pleasure&amp;#039; Sunday Mirror

 &amp;#039;Very thoughtful and written in a delightfully humorous and accessible way... Guaranteed to make [you] smile&amp;#039; Daily Express

 Is there a knack to being happy? From paddle-boarding down the Thames in a Santa hat, to wild swimming in a glacial river and cooking sausages on a campfire, Bill revels in the exhilaration of the outdoors, as well as the quieter pleasures of letter-writing, or of simple reflection.

 In this beautiful and uplifting book, Bill Bailey explores all this and more while delving into the nature of happiness, all in his own, remarkable, way.


 Packed with wisdom and humour, and with delightful illustrations by the comedian himself, Bill Bailey aims for the heart of pure joy and contentment - and how we can all achieve it.

*Bill Bailey will be dancing on Strictly Come Dancing from 17th October 2020*
